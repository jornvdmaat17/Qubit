# Qubit
Qubit class for calculating things with qubits.

Contains example file, qubit file containing Qubit class and an exception.

Qubit class has seven functions:
  -read
  -pauliX
  -pauliY
  -pauliZ
  -hadamard
  -sqrtNot
  -rphi
  
The last six apply certain gates to the the qubit, these gates can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate).
